# Templates

Every file here is **one example layout, not a required format.** Copy one, rewrite it for your field, and point `/tailor` at it with `--template`.

| File | Shape |
|---|---|
| `resume.tex.tmpl` | Default. One page. Summary, Skills, Projects, Experience, Education. Industry/software flavoured. |
| `resume-2page.tex.tmpl` | Longer form. Summary, Education, Experience, Skills, Publications, Leadership, Awards. Research/academic flavoured. |
| `cover-letter.tex.tmpl` | Cover letter, moderncv `classic`. Selected with `--cl-template`. |

## The template owns the sections

`/tailor` reads the `\rsection{...}` calls from whichever template you choose, top to bottom, ignoring `%`-commented lines, and that becomes the expected section list and reading order for the structural verify gate. There is no hardcoded list anywhere in the engine. A section whose profile data is empty is dropped rather than shipped as an empty heading.

So a different field just means a different template. Reorder the sections, rename them, add ones that don't exist here — the gate follows the file.

## Using your own

```
/tailor --template my-layout                 # -> templates/my-layout.tex.tmpl
/tailor --cl-template my-letter              # cover letter layout
/tailor --template ~/private/my-resume.tmpl  # any path, including outside this repo
/tailor --pages 2 --template my-layout       # a 2-page budget on a layout of your choosing
```

Keeping a personal template in a private repo is the recommended pattern — layouts tend to carry personal formatting choices, and `--template` takes a path precisely so it doesn't have to live here.

Retyping those paths gets old, so give them names in `resume_template` in `inputs/paths.yaml`:

```yaml
resume_template:
  default:       "~/private/my-resume.tmpl"        # used at a 1-page budget
  default_2page: "~/private/my-resume-2page.tmpl"  # used at 2 pages or more
  compact:       "my-layout"                       # -> templates/my-layout.tex.tmpl
```

Then `/tailor` picks the right one from the page budget alone, `--template compact` (or "use the compact layout") picks by name, and a path still works for a one-off. Omit the key entirely and the same page rule runs against the bundled layouts: `resume` at one page, `resume-2page` above — a one-page layout stretched to two pages has no Publications and no References section, which is rarely what was wanted.

## Cover letter templates

`cover-letter.tex.tmpl` uses `moderncv`, which Tectonic fetches on first compile. Three things bite:

- **Use `newtxtext`, not `mathptmx`.** Under XeTeX `mathptmx` leaves the font unresolved (`TU/ptm undefined`) and silently substitutes.
- **The recipient block is removed on purpose.** Stock `moderncv` prints "Hiring Manager / Unit / Organization" above the salutation — three lines the opening paragraph already says, costing about an inch. The template overrides `\makeletterhead` to drop it, along with the date line. Because nothing reads it any more, the template does not call `\recipient` at all.
- **If you restore the stock head, `\recipient` must have non-empty arguments.** Empty ones abort with `LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end.`

The margin floor below applies to resumes, where the scorer runs. Cover letters are not ATS-scored, so layout there is a matter of taste.

## References section (optional)

A template may end with a `\rsection{References}`. When it does, `/tailor --ref N` sizes it from `profile.references[]`: default 1 (the entry flagged `"default": true`), `--ref 0` drops the section, `N>1` makes the agent ask which referees to use. Templates without the section ignore the flag. Keep References last — a referee block above Education reads as a mistake.

## Rules any template must follow

**Keep the words intact for the extractor.** Every template here carries this block, and a custom one needs it too:

```latex
\tolerance=3000
\emergencystretch=3em
\hyphenpenalty=10000
\exhyphenpenalty=10000
\AtBeginDocument{\fontdimen4\font=0pt}
```

Two failures it prevents, both invisible on the printed page.

*Squeezed spaces.* When TeX compresses a justified line, interword space can shrink below what a PDF text extractor needs to see a word boundary. The line looks fine on screen and extracts as `graphneuralnetworks,machine-learnedinteratomicpotentials` — invisible to any ATS keyword scan.

*Hyphenation.* A word TeX breaks across a line keeps its hyphen in the extracted text: `configu-ration sampling`, `agen-tic`, `develop-ment`. The keyword is printed correctly and still never matches. Both penalties are needed — one for automatic hyphenation, one for breaking at a hyphen the word already has. On the bundled 2-page layout this lifted JD match 60 → 63 with no other change. Real compounds like `fine-tuning` keep their hyphen and stay on one line.

Both fixes cost a little vertical space and buy back the words. Don't reach for `\raggedright` instead: it dodges the space problem, does nothing for hyphenation, and a ragged block beside justified bullets reads as unfinished.

## Layout macros

The bundled templates define four helpers. A custom template does not have to use them, but `/tailor` checks two of them, so dropping them means dropping the check.

| Macro | What it does |
|---|---|
| `\rsection{Name}` | Section heading plus rule. Ends with `\par`, never `\\` — a `\\` leaves a blank source line rendering as a full empty line between the rule and the content. Also widens its own interword space to 0.33em, because at the default 0.25em some PDF viewers copy the heading back as `LEADERSHIP&TEAMWORKEXPERIENCE`. |
| `\rsummary{...}` | Wraps the Summary paragraph. Justified, and writes `SUMMARY-LINES: N` into the `.log` so the four-line cap is machine-checkable the same way the page budget is. |
| `\rsubgroup{Theme}` | 2-page layouts. A themed workstream inside one role: an open-circle marker plus bold text, indented one step so it reads as a child of the job title instead of a peer. |
| `rsubitems` | The `itemize` belonging to an `\rsubgroup`, indented one step further. A single-focus role takes a plain `itemize` at the margin. |


These are what keep a resume machine-readable. Break them and the ATS gate fails.

- **Margin floor 0.7in.** Below roughly 0.65in the bundled scorer false-detects a multi-column layout — `severity: fail`, automatic gate failure — and the text extraction scrambles: the header sinks into the middle of the document and lines split mid-word. Verified by bisection: 0.50-0.65 broken, 0.70+ clean. If a run reports `multi-column layout` on a single-column template, widen the margin before changing anything else. Never tighten below 0.7in to fit content; cut content instead.
- **Single column.** No `multicol`, no `tabular` for layout.
- **No images, icons, or graphical bullets.** Bullets come from `itemize`.
- **Contact recoverable.** Use `\href{mailto:...}` and `\href{tel:...}` so the scorer can extract email and phone even when they render as plain text. Missing phone costs 5 points, missing LinkedIn or portfolio 3.
- **11pt minimum**, and a Times-clone serif (`newtxtext`) or another font Tectonic bundles.
- **Escape LaTeX specials in visible text:** `\&`, `\%`, `\$`, `\#`, and underscores in URL display text. Unescaped ones either fail the compile or leak into the extraction.
- **Keep `\rsubgroup` indented and on its own paragraph** if your template defines one. A sub-heading that continues a previous line gets swallowed into it and stops being a heading, and flattening it to a flush-left `\textbf{...}` makes it look like another job title. Its `$\circ$` marker was measured against the bundled scorer and costs nothing; a glyph inside bullet *text* is a different matter and stays banned.

## Checking a template before you rely on it

```sh
./tectonic --keep-logs --outdir /tmp/t templates/my-layout.tex.tmpl
grep -o "Output written.*" /tmp/t/my-layout.tex.log     # page count
./tool /tmp/t/my-layout.tex.pdf --json | head -30       # must show no severity:fail
./tool /tmp/t/my-layout.tex.pdf --md /tmp/t/out.md      # header first? sections in order?
```
